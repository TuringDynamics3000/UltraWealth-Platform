### Hero
**Money is simple. Responsibility isn’t.**

UltraWealth is built for when money is more than personal.

CTA: See how it works  
Secondary CTA: Watch the progression

---

### Personal Context
Personal money needs clarity, not complexity.

Most financial tools assume you are acting alone.
They work well when decisions are personal and consequences are contained.

UltraWealth starts here.

*This view is intentionally personal.*

---

### The Breaking Point
Eventually, money stops being personal.

Responsibility appears when decisions affect more than one person:

- A trust or company is created
- Another person must approve
- A report is shared externally
- An advisor becomes involved
- Decisions carry consequence

When responsibility appears, the system must change.

---

### The Reveal
The moment responsibility appears, UltraWealth changes.

The same information now carries shared consequence.

What changes is how authority is handled:

- Authority becomes explicit
- Actions become deliberate
- Outputs can be relied upon
- Accountability is visible

This isn’t an upgrade.  
It’s a different state of operation.

---

### Structural Difference
Most platforms show information.  
UltraWealth decides what is allowed.

Dashboards → Decisions  
Accounts → Entities  
Data → Reliance

---

### Advisors
Advisors matter when responsibility matters.

Advisors are not required when money is personal.
They become essential when structure, authority, and reliance must be defined.

UltraWealth makes that transition explicit.

---

## How It Works

### Personal Context
In personal context, decisions are individual.

- One decision-maker
- No shared authority
- Information is for reference

---

### Responsibility Appears
Responsibility emerges when actions affect others.

This occurs when you:

- Add an entity
- Add another responsible party
- Share outputs externally
- Invite an advisor

The system does not ask.  
It changes.

---

### Governed Context
In governed context, authority is explicit.

- Roles are defined
- Actions are constrained
- Outputs are prepared for reliance

Group is not chosen.  
It is entered.

---

## When It Changes

Most people do not plan to manage shared responsibility.
It arrives naturally.

It begins when:

- Assets are held by an entity
- Decisions must be approved
- Information is relied upon
- External professionals are involved

Responsibility changes the rules.

UltraWealth is built for that moment.

---

## For Advisors

Advisors are participants in responsibility.

Their role is not to click buttons.
It is to define structure, clarify authority, and maintain reliance-safe outputs.

When money is personal, advisors are optional.
When money is shared, advisors become necessary.

Intelligence  
*Insight is meaningful only when the system is safe.*

## Pricing (If Displayed)

UltraWealth is not priced by features.

It is priced by governance capacity:

- Number of entities
- Number of responsible roles
- Number of relied-upon outputs

You are not paying for software.  
You are paying for responsibility handled correctly.

---

## Acceptance Test

A first-time visitor must conclude:

“Of course the system has to change when responsibility appears.”

If the site suggests an upgrade, plan, or feature tier, it is incorrect.
